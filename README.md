# Pirate_OOP

## Description
This program is a simulation of pirates on a sea of islands with a navy in the center attempting to stop the pirates. When the pirates come across an island there are many things they can do such as: fight the inhabitants of the island to make it their own, pass through the island if the people are friendly, ransack the island even though the people are friendly, and more. I encourage you to read the code for a full understanding of the possibilities. Additionally, the navy is actively trying to stop the pirates and they are based on an island with an established society in the middle of the sea. The coloured islands/squares are the pirates and the white island/square is the navy.
